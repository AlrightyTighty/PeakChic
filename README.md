In both folders, run npm i to install all dependencies

In the server folder, run npm run dev. This is all hosted locally at the time being, but we are planning on hosting via cloud in the future.
In the client folder, run npm run build. This will output the built project into the /dist folder. Run this folder as an unpacked chrome extension.
