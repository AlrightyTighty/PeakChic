# Vesta

A chrome extension to help the inclined shopper combat harmful fast-fashion products

# How to use

1. Install nodejs latest

2. Clone the repository

3. In both folders, run npm i to install all dependencies

4. In the server folder, run npm run dev. This is all hosted locally at the time being, but we are planning on hosting via cloud in the future.
   
5. In the client folder, run npm run build. This will output the built project into the /dist folder. Run this folder as an unpacked chrome extension.

6. Go to the page of a fashion product, run the extension, and scan the product! This may take awhile, depending on the size of the page. To ensure maximum accuracy, information is extracted **directly from web pages**. No info is made up or assumed from other sources.
